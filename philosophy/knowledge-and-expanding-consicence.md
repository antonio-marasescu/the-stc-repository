# On what is Knowledge

Knowledge comes in different flavours, either mental, physical or emotional.
Physical Knowledge is the ability to learn how your body functions, while mental knowlege is how your mind functions and what it retains. 
Emotional knowledge is how you feel about something in a certain context.

**Note**: Some will argue that emotional and mental knowledge are one and the same, or that all three flavours presented are just physical, this again depends on the context of your thinking approach. 
Do you prefer to think that you are just an organic robot and everything you feel is given by a set of events in your body, or are you an abstract entity which also inhabits a body. The truth can be both or none, `As above, so below`, maybe you are just physical knowldge or maybe you are more than three, or maybe you are you own
flavour of knowldge. 
This knowlegde is for you to discover, only if you choose to do so, and this requires for you to apply the Concept of **Change**.

# On expanding Conscience

My thoughts are focused on improving on-self. Usually, the notion human use is that through knowledge one can become more.
I agree with that statement, but I find insufficient in the grand scheme of things. 
So my questions is focused on what kind of knowledge do I need to expand myself? Are all kind of knowledge equally useful to you?

My thinking on this matter is the following:
1. Unknown knowledge is the most useful.
2. Not all knowledge is created equally.

Let me explain, I think it is pretty clear for everyone that something you already known or forgotten does not bring you anything more for yourself.
Take this example:

```
You are a programmer, who has become an expert in a particular framework/language. Everyday, you are confronted with a
set of tasks which you know you can solve succesfuly. At worst, the only issue you are confronted are physical limitation (either of time, either of your own motivation).
For several years you have done so, solving task after task and quickly becoming bored. 
One might say, that indeed there is a difference between the tasks done, and not each task is the same, you might need to think different to solve the task.
While this solution does indeed improves your creativity, it also is based on known knowledge. 
You create something from something else, you transform knowledge from a known source, through the process of creativity, to a solution for your task. 
In the end, you learn a solution, that representing the value of how much you expanded you consience.
I will also argue, that the programmer is becoming actually stagnant in his approach. Knowledge is discovered and learned by others, while he repeats a process each day.
Stagnancy leads to comfort, Comfort leads to fear of change.
```

So what kind of knowledge is useful? My train of thought leads to the idea that knowledge is useful when it can change something in you,
either in your mental process or in your physical body.
Thus, my thinking lead me to the following categories:
1. Ideas
2. Experiences
3. Emotions

They by itself are powerful starting places, but you can gain different levels of value if you try to compose them, to make one category affect the other.

## Ideas
These can come from the following sources:
1. Ideas gained from outside sources
  - Learned from introspection of one-self
  ```
   Examples: 
   - Thinking about different issues or happenings in your life and how to modify them (improving a situation, different approach in a conversation, etc)
   - Creating solutions for different problems in life.
   - Modifing a mental approach to a problem
   - Imagining different possible situations for a problem or events.
   - Thinking how you can make an event lead to a better or worst outcome (remember to not only think about the good)
  ```
2. Learned from repositories of knowledge (people, written sources)
  ```
   Examples:
    - Learning about events from books (how people in history handled different situations)
    - Learning about concepts, ideas from a tutorial video
    - Learning about life-experience of other people
    - Learning about fantasy/sci-fi ideas in books (this will help you expand your creativity)
  ```
And again these two categories can be composed. The example will be that you learn something from a repository, then imagine how such knowledge can be improved or handled diffrently.

On the subject learning from a repository of knowledge, I will also like to point out to take such an information always with a grain of salt. 
Everything is true in a certain context, even your own thoughts and ideas are true in the context of your mind. Exploring different contexts leads to different scenarios, and each scenario offers a different set of rules of how each action is performed.

## Experiences
This referes to situations, either physical or mental, which your consience experience during its lifetime.
These can vary and the my approach for their classification is by my definition in the idea of `Mastering an Experience`.
What I mean by that, is the situation where your experience with a thinking process, a physical event is so great that your own consience finds that experience mundane. 
Also, I want to point out is that mundanity of an experience is given also by the emotional impact it has on you and the context that experience is performed.

So, my classification is the following:
- Mundane Experiences (You have done it so many times, you don't even think to much about it and you don't learn anything new from them. E.g.: "drinking coffee")
- Normal Experiences (They happen sometimes and you still learn something new from them (either emotionally, mentally or phyiscally))
- Rare Experiences (These can happen extremelly rare or maybe never yet happened, they help you learn something you didn't know perfectly, or you didn't know, they help you feel something new, or something you never yet mastered)
```
Examples:
- Having to go through a rollercoaster, and you have a fear of them => multiple experiences can help you master that fear.
- Having to go through a rollecoaster, you love them => multiple experience can help you master that love, for it to reach mundanity.
- Experiencing a different culture, you've never been there => learn how they think and act
- Experiencing a different culture, you've been there but you just learned minimal information about their culture => learn a more profound knowledge of their culture.
- Going out with your friends to an old pub => mundane, you have done that so many times
- Going out with your friends to a new pub => normal experience, you learn something new about a new pub.
```

Each of these experience, depending on their contexts and on you require a different number of re-experience for you to fully master. 
From these category the rare experience most quickly help you gain a value in expanding your consience, but repeated and more profound certain experiences can provide a greater quantity of value in your expansion.

## Emotions

I find that emotions are a great way to expand your context space. Depending on how you feel about something, it changes your perspective on a certain event.
Being fearful about doing something, loving a certain event, can make an experience more profound. `Profound`, even that one word triggers a different reaction in how you feel, for every person something `profound` is not the same as for another. Emotion can change how your mental image about an event is formed and it helps you modify how you approach learning about something.
That is why I usually promote the mastering of one emotions. Remember I say `master` and not `control`, for I find that by controlling one emotions you limit yourself in how expand your conscience. Expanding and developing something requires the concept of `Change`, and change is born from `Chaos` and focused through `Order`.
Mastering one emotion is allowing one-self to change how one experience something (experience, idea) by force of will at any given time.

Therefore, on subject of expanding your conscience through emotion I will offer the following advice:
- Try to experience as many different events as possible so that they become more mundane.
- Use your mastering of emotions to switch contexts of different ideas and experiences and expand upon them.
- Try new experiences to learn diferent things and what kind of emotion you have about that thing.

Examples:
```
  You fear that rollercoaster, go try it and learn to master your fear.
  How do feel about a war in a certain remote area, think about being about one of the people being invaded, think about being the one who is doing the invasion and knowing your war is false, think about being the one who is doing the invasion and truly believing in your war.
  Taste some new kind of food, do you love/hate it? Can you try to force yourself to love it?
  How do you feel about a certain person? Can you try to force youself to hate/love him?
```
