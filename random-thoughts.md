# On expanding Conscience

My thoughts are focused on improving on-self. Usually, the notion human use is that through knowledge one can become more.
I agree with that statement, but I find insufficient in the grand scheme of things. 
So my questions is focused on what kind of knowledge do I need to expand myself? Are all kind of knowledge equally useful to you?

My thinking on this matter is the following:
1. Unknown knowledge is the most useful.
2. Not all knowledge is created equally.

Let me explain, I think it is pretty clear for everyone that something you already known or forgotten does not bring you anything more for yourself.
Take this example:

```
You are a programmer, who has become an expert in a particular framework/language. Everyday, you are confronted with a
set of tasks which you know you can solve succesfuly. At worst, the only issue you are confronted are physical limitation (either of time, either of your own motivation).
For several years you have done so, solving task after task and quickly becoming bored. 
One might say, that indeed there is a difference between the tasks done, and not each task is the same, you might need to think different to solve the task.
While this solution does indeed improves your creativity, it also is based on known knowledge. 
You create something from something else, you transform knowledge from a known source, through the process of creativity, to a solution for your task. 
In the end, you learn a solution, that representing the value of how much you expanded you consience.
I will also argue, that the programmer is becoming actually stagnant in his approach. Knowledge is discovered and learned by others, while he repeats a process each day.
Stagnancy leads to comfort, Comfort leads to fear of change.
```

So what kind of knowledge is useful? This lead me to the following categories:
1. Ideas
2. Experiences
3. Emotions

## Ideas
These can come from the following sources:
1. Ideas gained from outside sources
  - Learned from introspection of oneself
  ```
   Examples: 
   - Thinking about different issues or happenings in your life and how to modify them (improving a situation, different approach in a conversation, etc)
   - Creating solutions for different problems in life.
   - Modifing a mental approach to a problem
   - Imagining different possible situations for a problem or events.
   - Thinking how you can make an event lead to a better or worst outcome (remember to not only think about the good)
  ```
  - Learned from repositories of knowledge (people, written sources)
