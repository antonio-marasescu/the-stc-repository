## Definitions

- **Zero-Day Vulnerability** = vulnerability or exploit that is unkown today *(in other words "you have 0 days to get it fixed")*. If hacker uses this vulnerability it will be known as a **Zero-Day Exploit**.

## CSRF

It is used to produce state changes to the backend through the credentials of a legit authenticated user. 
Basically, a user enters on a malicious website, which in turn will make an automatic request to our API 
and sending the user login data (most usually the auth cookies) with a request which will cause a state change in our backend (e.g.: transfer money A -> B).
This will be seen as a legit request by the backend due to the valid credentials.
- Note this security vulnerability is mostly true for cookie-based authentication.

### How to secure

Server-side generate a random token in a cookie, frontend will read said cookie and send it with each subsequent http request in the headers.
The Server will verify this token and perform action if valid.
