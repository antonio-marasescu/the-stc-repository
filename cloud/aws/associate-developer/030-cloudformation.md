# CloudFormation

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you want to:
    - I want a security group
    - I want two EC2 machines using this security group
    - I want two Elastic IPs for these EC2 machines
    - I want an S3 bucket
    - I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
    - Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

## Benefits

- Infrastructure as code
    - No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
    - The code can be version controlled for example using git
    - Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
- Cost
    - Each resource within the stack is staged with an identifier, so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
    - You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
    - Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely
- Productivity
    - Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
    - Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
    - Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
- Separation of concern: create many stacks for many apps, and many layers. Ex:
    - PC stacks
    - Network stacks
    - App stacks
- Don’t re-invent the wheel
    - Leverage existing templates on the web!
    - Leverage the documentation

## How it works

- Templates have to be uploaded in S3 and then referenced in CloudFormation
- To update a template, we can’t edit previous ones. We have to re-upload a new version of the template to AWS
- Stacks are identified by a name
- Deleting a stack deletes every single artifact that was created by CloudFormation.

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Templates   | The JSON or YAML text file that contains the instructions for building out the AWS environment                                                                                    |
| Stacks      | The entire environment described by the template and created, updated, and deleted as a single unit                                                                               |
| StackSets   | AWS CloudFormation StackSets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation |
| Change Sets | A summary of proposed changes to your stack that will allow you to see how those changes might impact your existing resources before implementing them                            |


## Deploying CloudFormation templates

- Manual way:
    - Editing templates in the CloudFormation Designer
    - Using the console to input parameters, etc
- Automated way:
    - Editing templates in a YAML file
    - Using the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) to deploy the templates
    - Recommended way when you fully want to automate your flow

## CloudFormation Building Blocks

- Templates components (one course section for each):
	1. Resources: your AWS resources declared in the template (MANDATORY)
    2. Parameters: the dynamic inputs for your template
    3. Mappings: the static variables for your template
    4. Outputs: References to what has been created
    5. Conditionals: List of conditions to perform resource creation
    6. Metadata
- Templates helpers:
    1. References
    2. Functions

### CloudFormation Resources

- Resources are the core of your CloudFormation template (MANDATORY)
- They represent the different AWS Components that will be created and configured
- Resources are declared and can reference each other
- AWS figures out creation, updates and deletes of resources for us
- Resource types identifiers are of the form:
    - `AWS::aws-product-name::data-type-name`

### CloudFormation Parameters

- Parameters are a way to provide inputs to your AWS CloudFormation template
- They’re important to know about if:
    - You want to reuse your templates across the company
    - Some inputs can not be determined ahead of time
- Parameters are extremely powerful, controlled, and can prevent errors from happening in your templates thanks to types.
- AWS offers us pseudo parameters in any CloudFormation template.
- These can be used at any time and are enabled by default

#### How to reference a parameter

- The `Fn::Ref` function can be leveraged to reference parameters
- Parameters can be used anywhere in a template.
- The shorthand for this in YAML is !Ref
- The function can also reference other elements within the template

#### CloudFormation Mappings

- Mappings are fixed variables within your CloudFormation Template.
- They’re very handy to differentiate between different environments (dev vs prod), regions (AWS regions), AMI types, etc
- All the values are hardcoded within the template
- We use `Fn::FindInMap` to return a named value from a specific key


### CloudFormation Outputs

- The Outputs section declares optional outputs values that we can import into other stacks (if you export them first)!
- You can also view the outputs in the AWS Console or in using the AWS CLI
- They’re very useful for example if you define a network CloudFormation, and output the variables such as VPC ID and your Subnet IDs
- It’s the best way to perform some collaborations cross stack, as you let expert handle their own part of the stack
- You can’t delete a CloudFormation Stack if its outputs are being referenced by another CloudFormation stack

## CloudFormation Conditions

- The logical ID is for you to choose. It’s how you name condition
- The intrinsic function (logical) can be any of the following:
    - `Fn::And` `Fn::Equals`
    - `Fn::If`
    - `Fn::Not`
    - `Fn::Or`
- Conditions can be applied to resources / outputs / etc

## CloudFormation Intrinsic Functions

- Refs
    - The `Fn::Ref` function can be leveraged to reference
        - Parameters => returns the value of the parameter
        - Resources => returns the physical ID of the underlying resource (ex: EC2 ID)
    - The shorthand for this in YAML is `!Ref`
- `Fn::GetAtt`
    - Attributes are attached to any resources you create
    - To know the attributes of your resources, the best place to look at is the documentation.
    - For example: the AZ of an EC2 machine
- `Fn::FindInMap`
    - We use `Fn::FindInMap` to return a named value from a specific key
    - `!FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]`
- `Fn::ImportValue`
    - Import values that are exported in other templates
        - Use the `Fn::ImportValue` function
- `Fn::Join`
    - Join values with a delimiter
- `Fn::Sub`
    - `Fn::Sub`, or `!Sub` as a shorthand, is used to substitute variables from a text. It’s a very handy function that will allow you to fully customize your templates.
    - For example, you can combine `Fn::Sub` with References or AWS Pseudo variables
    - String must contain ${VariableName} and will substitute them
- Condition Functions (`Fn::If`, `Fn::Not`, `Fn::Equals`, etc...)
    - The logical ID is for you to choose. It’s how you name condition
    - The intrinsic function (logical) can be any of the following:
        - `Fn::And`
        - `Fn::Equals`
        - `Fn::If`
        - `Fn::Not`
        - `Fn::Or`

#### CloudFormation Rollbacks

- Stack Creation Fails
    - Default: everything rolls back (gets deleted).We can look at the log
    - Option to disable rollback and troubleshoot what happened
- Stack Update Fails:
    - The stack automatically rolls back to the previous known working state
    - Ability to see in the log what happened and error messages

## Exam Tips

- The stack may be stuck in the DELETE_FAILED state because the dependent object (security group), can't be deleted. This can be for many reasons, for example, the security group could have an ENI attached that’s not part of the CloudFormation stack. To delete the stack you must choose to delete the stack in the console and then select to retain the resource(s) that failed to delete. This can also be achieved from the AWS CLI:
