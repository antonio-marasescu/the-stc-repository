Aurora Replicas can help improve read scaling because it synchronously updates data with the primary database (within 100 ms). Aurora Replicas are created in the same DB cluster within a Region. With Aurora MySQL you can also enable binlog replication to another Aurora DB cluster which can be in the same or a different Region.
