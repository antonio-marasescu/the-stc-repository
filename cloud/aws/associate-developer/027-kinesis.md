# Kinesis

Kinesis is a managed service service which makes it easy to collect and analyze data and video streams in real time. It is considered a managed alternative for Apache Kafka.
- Kinesis Streams: low latency streaming ingest at scale
	- there exists also Kinesis Video Streams (capture, process, and store video streams)
- Kinesis Analytics: real-time analytics on streams using SQL (with SQL or Apache Flink)
- Kinesis Firehose: load streams into S3, Redshift, Elastic etc.

## Overview

- Streams are divided in shards/partitions.
- Data is ordered in shards
- Data can be replayed
- Multiple applications can consume the same stream
- Data in Kinesis is immutable

## Shards

- A stream can contain one or more shards
- Write capacity: 1MB/s or 1000 messages per shard
- Read capacity: 2MB/s per shard
- Billing is per shard
- Records are ordered per shard

## Kinesis API

- PutRecord API: requires a partition key which gets hashed.
- Partition key should be highly distributed (otherwise a shard can become overwhelmed)
- PutRecord accepts batches, cost can be reduced
- PutRecord throws ProvisionedThroughputExceeded in case of capacity is exceeded. Solution: exponential back-off, more shards, ensure that partition key is highly distributed

## Kinesis Client Library (KCL)

- It is a Java library that helps read record from a Kinesis Data Stream with distributed applications sharing the read workload
- Each shard should be read by only one KCL instance!
- Progress checkpoint is written to DynamoDB
- Records are read in order at the shard level
- KCL can run on EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, and on-premises
## Security

- IAM policies
- Encryption at flight using HTTPS
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- Client side encryption/decryption (should be done manually)
- VPC Endpoints available for Kinesis
- Monitor API calls using CloudTrail
## Kinesis Data Streams

- Retention between 1 day to 365 days
- Ability to reprocess (replay) data
- Once data is inserted in Kinesis, it can’t be deleted (immutability)
- Data that shares the same partition goes to the same shard (ordering)
- Producers: AWS SDK, Kinesis Producer Library (KPL), Kinesis Agent
- Consumers:
	- Write your own: Kinesis Client Library (KCL), AWS SDK
	- Managed: AWS Lambda, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Analytics
- Capacity Modes
	- Provisioned mode:
		- You choose the number of shards provisioned, scale manually or using API
		- Each shard gets 1MB/s in (or 1000 records per second)
		- Each shard gets 2MB/s out (classic or enhanced fan-out consumer)
		- You pay per shard provisioned per hour
	- On-demand mode:
		- No need to provision or manage the capacity
		- Default capacity provisioned (4 MB/s in or 4000 records per second)
		- Scales automatically based on observed throughput peak during the last 30 days
		- Pay per stream per hour & data in/out per GB
## Kinesis Data Analytics

- Real-time analytics on Kinesis Streams using SQL
- Pay for actual consumption, no need to pre-provision anything
- Can create streams from query results

## Kinesis Firehose

- Used for ETL, can load data into Redshift, S3, ElasticSearch etc.
- **Near Real Time**
	- Buffer interval: 0 seconds (no buffering) to 900 seconds
	- Buffer size: minimum 1MB
- Fully managed, automatic scaling
- Low latency (60 seconds)
- Pay for the amount of data which goes through Firehose

## SQS vs SNS vs Kinesis

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Consumer pulls data|Data is pushed to many subscribers|Consumer pulls data|
|Data is deleted after consumed|Up to 10 million subscribers|Can have as many consumer as we want|
|Can have as many consumer as we want|Data os not persisted|Can replay data|
|No need to provision throughput|Pub/Sub|Used for big data analytics and ETL|
|No ordering (except FIFO)|Up to 100k topics|Data expires after X days|
|Individual message delay capability|No need to provision throughput|Must provision throughput|
||Integrates with SQS for fan-out architecture|Ordering at the shard level|

## Kinesis Operations

- Shard Splitting
	- Used to increase the Stream capacity (1 MB/s data in per shard)
	- Used to divide a “hot shard”
	- The old shard is closed and will be deleted once the data is expired
	- No automatic scaling (manually increase/decrease capacity)
	- Can’t split into more than two shards in a single operation
- Merging Shards
	- Decrease the Stream capacity and save costs
	- Can be used to group two shards with low traffic (cold shards)
	- Old shards are closed and will be deleted once the data is expired
	- Can’t merge more than two shards in a single operation
