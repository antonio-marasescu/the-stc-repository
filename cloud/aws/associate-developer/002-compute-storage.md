# EBS Volume

Amazon _Elastic Block Storage_ allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from failure of a single component (i.e. they exist across multiple physical drives). Think of EBS as a disk in the cloud that you attach to your EC2 instance.

- An EC2 machine loses its root volume (main drive) when it is manually terminated.
- Unexpected terminations might happen from time to time (AWS would email you)
- Sometimes, you need a way to store your instance data somewhere.
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
- It allows your instances to persist data

## EBS Volume

- It’s a network drive (Not a physical drive)
	- It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
	- It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
	- An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
	- To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs and IOPs)
	- You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
	- You can increase the capacity of the drive over time
- Have a `delete-on-termination` attribute that controls behavior on EC2 termination

#### Volumes Types

EBS Volumes come in 4 types:
- gp2/gp3 (SSD): general purpose SSD for good balance (e.g.: most workloads, VM workloads, System boot volumes, low-latency interactive apps, development and test environments)
- io1/io2 (SSD): high performance SSD for low-latency or high-throughput workloads (e.g.: database workloads, critical business applications that require sustained IOPS, or more than 16000 IOPS per volume (gp2 limit))
- st1 (HDD): low cost HDD volume for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads (e.g.: Big Data, Data Warehouse, Log Processing workloads, Apache Kafka)
- sc1 (HDD): lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads

**Notes:**
- Only GP2 and IO1 can be used as boot volumes
- GP2 limit is 16000
- EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS

#### EBS Volume Resizing

- Feb 2017: You can resize your EBS Volumes
- After resizing an EBS volume, you need to repartition your drive

#### EBS Snapshots

- EBS Volumes can be backed up using “snapshots”
- Snapshots only take the actual space of the blocks on the volume
- If you take a snapshot of a 100GB drive that only has 5 GB of data, then your EBS snapshot will only be 5 GB
- Snapshots are used for:
    - Backups: ensuring you can save your data in case of catastrophe
    - Volume migration
        - Resizing a volume down
        - Changing the volume type
        - Encrypt a volume
- Recycle BIN for EBS Snapshots = allows to setup rules to retain deleted snapshot (in case of accidental deletion), you can specify retention (1 day to 1 year)
- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) = force full initialization of snapshot to `no latency` on first use (is costly)

#### EBS Encryption

- When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
    - Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
    - All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
    - All snapshots are encrypted
    - All volumes created from the snapshots are encrypted
- Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)
- Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
- EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
- Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption


## EC2 Instance Store

Represent a high-performance hardware disk which has the following properties:
- Better I/0 performance
- Lose storage if stopped (ephemeral)
- Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
- Risk of data if hardware fails
- Backup & Replication are your reasonability

## Elastic File System (EFS)

- Is a managed NFS (network file system) which **can be mounted on 100s of EC2**.
- Works with only **Linux** EC2 instances in **multi-AZ**, scale automatically and pay for use
- Highly available, scalable, expensive, pay per use, no capacity planning
- Use cases: content management, web serving, data sharing, WordPress
- Uses NFSv4.1 protocol and you control access through a security group

### EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)

- Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every days
- EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed
- Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy 

## Amazon FSx
A fully-managed, high-performance file system on AWS.

For Windows File Serve
- **Windows native** shared file system
- Built on Windows File Server
- Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
- Integrated with Microsoft Active Directoy
- Can be accessed from AWS or your on-premise infrastructure
For Lustre (derived from 'Linux' and 'cluster')
- used for Linux File System
- used for High Performance Computing (HPC)
- Scales up to 100s GB/s, million IOPS


## EBS vs. Instance Store

- Some instance do not come with Root EBS volumes
- Instead, they come with “instance Store”
- Instance store is physically attached to the machine
- Pros:
    - Better I/O performance
- Cons:
    - On termination, the instance store is lost
    - You can’t resize the instance store
    - Backups must be operated by the user
- Overall, EBS-backed instances should fit most applications workloads

## Summary

- EBS can be attached to only one instance at a time
- EBS are locked at the AZ level
- Migrating an EBS volume across AZ means first backing it up (snapshot), then recreating it in the other AZ
- EBS backups use IO and you shouldn’t run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic
- Root EBS Volumes of instances get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated. (You can disable that)
- In some cases, it's better to externalize your RDS database so that it won't get deleted when you delete your elastic beanstalk environment
- Elastic Beanstalk relies on CloudFormation

### Use Cases Summary

- Big Data / Data Warehouses / Log Processing : ST1 (HDD)
- Lowest storage cost : SC1 (HDD)
- NoSQL such as MongoDB, Cassandra or MSQL : IO1 (SSD)
- Low latency applications : GP2 (SSD)
