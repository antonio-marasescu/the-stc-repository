# Key Management Service

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.

- AWS manages encryption keys for us
- Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
- Easy way to control access to your data
- Able to audit KMS Key usage using CloudTrail
- Seamlessly integrated into most AWS services (EBS, S3, RDS, SSM…)
- Different Encryption Types:
	- Symmetric (AES-256)
		- Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
		- AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
	- Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pair)
		- Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
		- Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations
		- The public key is downloadable, but you can’t access the Private Key unencrypted

### KMS Key Types

**Types**
- AWS Owned Keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB
- AWS Managed Key (free): (aws/service-name, e.g.: aws/rds)
- Customer managed keys created in KMS: $1 / month
- Customer managed keys imported (must be symmetric key): $1 / month

**Automated Key Rotation:**
- AWS-managed KMS Key: automatic every 1 year 
- Customer-managed KMS Key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year
- Imported KMS Key: only manual rotation possible using alias

**Key Policies**
- Control access to KMS keys, “similar” to S3 bucket policies\
- Difference: you cannot control access without them
- You can allow cross-account access for snapshots for example
- Default KMS Key Policy: 
	- Created if you don’t provide a specific KMS Key Policy
	- Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account
- Custom KMS Key Policy:
	- Define users, roles that can access the KMS key
	- Define who can administer the key
	- Useful for cross-account access of your KMS key

## API Summary

- Encrypt: encrypt up to 4 KB of data through KMS 
- GenerateDataKey: generates a unique symmetric data key (DEK) 
	- returns a plaintext copy of the data key 
	- AND a copy that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify
	- returns a plaintext version of the key and a copy of the key encrypted under a KMS key. The application can use the plaintext key to encrypt data, and then discard it from memory as soon as possible to reduce potential exposure.
- GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext: 
	- Generate a DEK to use at some point (not immediately) 
	- DEK that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify (must use Decrypt later) 
- Decrypt: decrypt up to 4 KB of data (including Data Encryption Keys) 
- GenerateRandom: Returns a random byte string

## Envelope Encryption

- KMS Encrypt API call has a limit of 4 KB
- If you want to encrypt >4 KB, we need to use Envelope Encryption 
- The main API that will help us is the GenerateDataKey API
- Encrypt: You get the plaintext data key => you encrypt your file alongside the encrypted data key and you send all of it where you need
- Decrypt: You call the decrypt api and get a plaintext data key => you use it to decrypt your file
