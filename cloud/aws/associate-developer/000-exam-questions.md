1. A programmer is creating an application that requires signed requests (Signature Version 4) for invoking other AWS services. Having constructed a canonical request, created the string to sign, and calculated the signing information, which strategies can the programmer apply to finalize a signed request? (Select TWO.)
	1. When sending a request to AWS services using Signature Version 4, the signature should be included in the "Authorization" HTTP header or as a parameter "X-Amz-Signature" in the query string.
2. A Development team has deployed several applications running on an Auto Scaling fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The Operations team have asked for a display that shows a key performance metric for each application on a single screen for monitoring purposes.
	1. Create a custom namespace with a unique metric name for each application
	2. Explanation: Therefore, the Developer should create a custom namespace with a unique metric name for each application. This namespace will then allow the metrics for each individual application to be shown in a single view through CloudWatch.
3. An application is using Amazon DynamoDB as its data store and needs to be able to read 100 items per second as strongly consistent reads. Each item is 5 KB in size. What value should be set for the table's provisioned throughput for reads?
	1. To determine the number of RCUs required to handle 100 strongly consistent reads per/second with an average item size of 5KB, perform the following steps:
	2. Determine the average item size by rounding up the next multiple of 4KB (5KB rounds up to 8KB).
	3. Determine the RCU per item by dividing the item size by 4KB (8KB/4KB = 2).
	4. Multiply the value from step 2 with the number of reads required per second (2x100 = 200).
4. An application uses both Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. The on-premises servers are a critical component of the application, and a developer wants to collect metrics and logs from these servers. The developer would like to use Amazon CloudWatch. How can the developer accomplish this?
	1. Install the CloudWatch agent on the on-premises servers and specify IAM credentials with permissions to CloudWatch.
5. A Developer is designing a fault-tolerant environment where client sessions will be saved. How can the Developer ensure that no sessions are lost if an Amazon EC2 instance fails?
	1. Use Amazon DynamoDB to perform scalable session handling
	2. The **DynamoDB Session Handler** is a custom session handler for PHP that allows developers to use Amazon DynamoDB as a session store. Using DynamoDB for session storage alleviates issues that occur with session handling in a distributed web application by moving sessions off of the local file system and into a shared location. DynamoDB is fast, scalable, easy to setup, and handles replication of your data automatically.
6. An application uses Amazon API Gateway, an AWS Lambda function and a DynamoDB table. The developer requires that another Lambda function is triggered when an item lifecycle activity occurs in the DynamoDB table.
	1. Enable a DynamoDB stream and trigger the Lambda function synchronously from the stream
7. A company uses an Amazon S3 bucket to store a large number of sensitive files relating to eCommerce transactions. The company has a policy that states that all data written to the S3 bucket must be encrypted.
	1. Create an S3 bucket policy that denies any S3 Put request that does not include the x-amz-server-side-encryption
8. An application is being migrated into the cloud. The application is stateless and will run on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The application should scale elastically. How can a Developer ensure that the number of instances available is sufficient for current demand?
	1. Create a launch configuration and use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
9. A Developer is designing a cloud native application. The application will use several AWS Lambda functions that will process items that the functions read from an event source. Which AWS services are supported for Lambda event source mappings? (Select THREE.)
	1. Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
	2. Amazon DynamoDB
	3. Amazon Kinesis
10. An engineer is constructing an AWS Lambda function and intends to log specific key events that transpire during the function's execution. To correlate the events with a particular function invocation, the engineer is looking to incorporate a unique identifier. The following code segment has been added to the Lambda function: function handler (event, context) {}
	1. Use **context.awsRequestId** within the function to fetch the unique identifier associated with each invocation.

Each partner sends orders by calling a customized API that is exposed through API Gateway. The API call invokes a shared Lambda function to process the orders.  
Partners need to be notified after the Lambda function processes the orders. Each partner must receive updates for only the partner's own orders. The company wants to add new partners in the future with the fewest code changes possible.  
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST scalable way?

C. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure the Lambda function to publish messages with specific attributes to the SNS topic. Subscribe each partner to the SNS topic. Apply the appropriate filter policy to the topic subscriptions.

#### Question 14 (marked)

A financial company must store original customer records for 10 years for legal reasons. A complete record contains personally identifiable information (PII). According to local regulations, PII is available to only certain people in the company and must not be shared with third parties. The company needs to make the records available to third-party organizations for statistical analysis without sharing the PII.  
A developer wants to store the original immutable record in Amazon S3. Depending on who accesses the S3 document, the document should be returned as is or with all the PII removed. The developer has written an AWS Lambda function to remove the PII from the document. The function is named removePii.  
What should the developer do so that the company can meet the PII requirements while maintaining only one copy of the document?

C. Create an S3 Object Lambda access point from the S3 console. Select the removePii function. Use S3 Access Points to access the object without PII. (An S3 Object Lambda access point is a new type of access point that you can create to invoke your own AWS Lambda function to modify the content of an S3 object. You can use S3 Object Lambda access points to transform data as it is being retrieved from an S3 bucket, without modifying the original data stored in the bucket)

#### Question 27 (marked)

A developer wants to expand an application to run in multiple AWS Regions. The developer wants to copy Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with the latest changes and create a new application stack in the destination Region. According to company requirements, all AMIs must be encrypted in all Regions. However, not all the AMIs that the company uses are encrypted.  
How can the developer expand the application to run in the destination Region while meeting the encryption requirement?

A. Create new AMIs, and specify encryption parameters. Copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination Region. Delete the unencrypted AMIs.

Note: The best solution for meeting the encryption requirement is to create new AMIs with encryption enabled and copy them to the destination Region. By default, when an AMI is copied to another Region, it is not encrypted in the destination Region even if it is encrypted in the source Region. Therefore, the developer must create new encrypted AMIs that can be used in the destination Region. Once the new encrypted AMIs have been created, they can be copied to the destination Region. The unencrypted AMIs can then be deleted to ensure that all instances running in all Regions are using only encrypted AMIs.

What steps must be followed?

D. Invoke the GenerateDataKey API to retrieve the plaintext version of the data encryption key to encrypt the data

#### Question 41

An application uses Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest and process large streams of data records in real time. Amazon EC2 instances consume and process the data from the shards of the Kinesis data stream by using Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL). The application handles the failure scenarios and does not require standby workers. The application reports that a specific shard is receiving more data than expected. To adapt to the changes in the rate of data flow, the  
`hot` shard is resharded.  
Assuming that the initial number of shards in the Kinesis data stream is 4, and after resharding the number of shards increased to 6, what is the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be deployed to process data from all the shards?

B. 6
