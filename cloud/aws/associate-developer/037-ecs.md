Amazon ECS supports the following task placement strategies:

**binpack** - Place tasks based on the least available amount of CPU or memory. This minimizes the number of instances in use.

**random** - Place tasks randomly.

**spread** - Place tasks evenly based on the specified value. Accepted values are instanceId (or host, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as attribute:ecs.availability-zone. Service tasks are spread based on the tasks from that service. Standalone tasks are spread based on the tasks from the same task group
