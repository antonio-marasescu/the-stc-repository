# ASG: Auto Scaling Group

Offers the ability for your application to scale based on load by creating and getting rid of servers very quickly.

The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
- Scale out (add EC2 Instances) to match an increased load
- Scale in (remove EC2 Instances) to match a decreased load
- Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
- Automatically register new instances to a load balancer

**Scalability** = application can handle greater loads by adapting

There are 2 types of scalability:
- Vertical (increasing the size of the instance)
- Horizontal (increasing the number of instances)
**High Availability** = running your application in at least 2 Availability Zones
**Elasticity** = scale per use (if low-use down-scale, if highly-used up-scale)

ASGs have the following attributes:
- A launch configuration
	- AMI + Instance Type
	- EC2 User Data
	- EBS Volumes
	- Security Groups
	- SSH Key Pair
- Min / Max Size + Initial Capacity
- Network + Subnets Information
- Load Balancer Information
- Scaling Policies

**Scaling Strategies**
1. Manual Scaling: Update the size (minimum, maximum, desired) of an ASG manually
2. Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
  - Simple / Step Scalling: based on threashold (CloudWatch CPU > 70% or < 30% => scale out / scale in)
  - Target Tracking Scaling: E.g.: I want the average ASG CPU to stay around 40%
  - Scheduled Scaling:  E.g.: increase minimum capacity to 10 at 5 pm
  - Predictive Scaling: use ML to predict future traffic
## Scaling Options

Auto Scaling Alarms
- It is possible to scale an ASG Based on CloudWatch Alarms
- An alarms monitors a metric (such as Average CPU)
- Metrics are computed for the overall ASG instances
- Based on that alarm
	- We can create scale-out / scale-in policies
New Auto Scaling Rules
- It is now possible to define "better" auto-scaling rules that are directly managed by EC2
	- Target Average CPU Usage
	- Number of Request on the ELB per instance
	- Average Network In
	- Average Network Out
	- These rules are easier to set up and can make more sense
Auto Scaling Custom Metric
- We can auto-scale based on a custom metric (ex: number of connected users)
	- Send custom metrics from an application on EC2 to CloudWatch (PutMetric API)
	- Create CloudWatch Alarm to react to low/high values
	- Use the CloudWatch alarm as the scaling policy for ASG

#### ASG Summary
* Scaling policies can be on CPU, Networkâ€¦ and can even be on custom metrics or based on a schedule (if you know your visitors patterns)
* ASGs use Launch configurations, and you update an ASG by providing a new launch configuration
* IAM roles attached to an ASG will get assigned to EC2 instances
* ASG are free. You pay for the underlying resources being launched
* Having instances under an ASG means that if they get terminated for whatever reason, the ASG will restart them. Extra safety
* ASG can terminate instances marked as unhealthy by an LB (and hence replace them)
