# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS provides Cloud computing which means providing capabilities for a developer to don't manage his infrastructure at home/work and only focus on development.

There are several types of how access can be provided:
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) 
  - provides building blocks for cloud IT
  - provides networking, computers and data storage space
  - Note: basically you manage everything but computers, but you manage the OS running on the computers (e.g.: EC2)
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)
  - Removes the need for your organization to manage underlying infrastructure
  - Focus on deployment and management of your application
  - Note: basically you manage only the application and data, but you don't manage the OS (e.g.: Elastic Beanstalk)
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service)
  - is a completed product that is run and managed by a service provider
  - Note: you directly interact through an application for every feature (e.g.: Rekognition, Dropbox, Gmail, etc.)
