# Global Infrastructure 

A **global** application is an application deployed in multiple geographic locations (on AWS this could Regions or Edge Locations).
This will offer you decreased latency (time for a network packet to reach a server) and disaster recovery (if aws region goes to down represent a failover for you application to still work).

On AWS this is made by:
- **Regions**: for deploying applications and infrastructure
- **Availability Zones** (inside of a region): made of multiple data centers
- **Edge Location** (Points of Presence): for fast content delivery

## Summary

### Global Applications in AWS - Summary
- Global DNS: Route 53
  - Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
  - Great for disaster recovery strategies
- Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
  - Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations – decrease latency
  - Cache common requests – improved user experience and decreased latency
- S3 Transfer Acceleration
  - Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3
- AWS Global Accelerator
  - Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
- AWS Outposts
  - Deploy Outposts Racks in your own Data Centers to extend AWS services
- AWS WaveLength
  - Brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks
  - Ultra-low latency applications
- AWS Local Zones
  - Bring AWS resources (compute, database, storage, …) closer to your users
  -  Good for latency-sensitive applications

## Global Application in AWS

### Global DNS: Route 53

A managed DNS (Domain Name System = a collection of rules and records which help clients understand how to reach a server through URLs) offered by AWS.
There are several **Routing Policies** offered:
- Simple Routing Policy (no health checks)
- Weighted Routing Policy (route based on a weight on how much traffic should go somewhere)
- Latency Routing Policy (based on user location)
- Failover Routing Policy (with a healthcheck)

### Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront

A content delivery network (CDN) offered by AWS which will offer an increased read performance with content cached at the edge. It has included a DDOS protection due to its integration with Shield and AWS Web Application Firewall.
Used in corellation with S3 for distributing files (or static websites) and can be used as an ingress (for uploading files).

#### Cloudfront vs S3 Cross Region Replication

Basically Cloudfront is great for static content with limited setup vs Cross Region replication which is great for dynamic content and which requires some setup.

### S3 Transfer Acceleration

A service to increase transfer speed of file upload by transfering to an AWS edge location which will later forward it to a S3 bucket in the target region.

### AWS Global Accelerator

It helps improve global application **availability** and **performance** using the AWS global network. Basically it uses aws internal network to optimize the route to your application:
- 2 anycast IP are created for you application and traffic is sent through edge locations

As a comparison against CloudFront the AWS Global Accelerator is just proxying packets and improves performance for TCP or UDP (good for HTTP use cases that requried static IP addresses or deterministic fast regional failover)

### AWS Outposts

Its intended for the Hybrid Cloud business (cloud + on premise infrastructure) by providing "server racks" that offers the same AWS functionality as cloud-based services. This is done by having AWS setup and manage "Outposts racks" withing your on-premise infrastructure (you will be responsabile for physical security).
It offer low-latency, local data processing, data residency and a fully managed service with wide variety of AWS services working on it (EC2, EBS, S3, EKS, ECS, RDS, EMR).

### AWS WaveLength

Wavelength Zones represent Infrastructure depyloment integrate with telecommunication providers datacenter at the edge of the 5G networks.
Used for ultra-low latency application through 5G networks (traffic doesn't leave Communication Service Provider's (CSP) network).

### AWS Local Zones

Placecs AWS compute, storage, databse and other selected AWS services closer to end users to run latency-sensistive application. Basically extends your VPC to more locations and is compatible with EC2, RDS, ECS, EBS, ElastiCache, etc.
