# Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) & Auto-Scaling Groups (ASG)

**Scalability** = application can handle greater loads by adapting

There are 2 types of scalability:
- Vertical (increasing the size of the instance)
- Horizontal (increasing the number of instances)

**High Availability** = running your application in at least 2 Availability Zones
**Elasticity** = scale per use (if low-use down-scale, if highly-used up-scale)

**Load Balancers** = servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers downstream.
They are used for:
- Spreading load across multiple instances
- Exposes a single-point of access (DNS) to your application
- Seamlessly handle failure of downstream instancs
- Do regular healthchecks
- Provide SSL
- High Availability

## Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

Represents a managed load balancer (aws guarantees: it will be working, upgrades, maintenance, high availability, configuration knobs).
It has 3 types:
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) (HTTP(s)) - works on layer 7 (OSI model)
- Network Load Balancer (NLB) (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP) - works on layer 4
- Classic Load Balancer (slowly retiring) - works on layer 7 and 4


## Auto-Scaling Group (ASG)

It represents a functionality which allows you:
- Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
- Scale in (remove EC2 instance) to match a decreased load
- Ensure minimun and maximum number of instances
- Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
- Replace unhealthy instances
- Cost savings (only run at optimal capacity)

**Scaling Strategies**
1. Manual Scaling: Update the size (minimum, maximum, desired) of an ASG manually
2. Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
  - Simple / Step Scalling: based on threashold (CloudWatch CPU > 70% or < 30% => scale out / scale in)
  - Target Tracking Scaling: E.g.: I want the average ASG CPU to stay around 40%
  - Scheduled Scaling:  E.g.: increase minimum capacity to 10 at 5 pm
  - Predictive Scaling: use ML to predict future trafic
