# Pricing and Billing

## Pricing Models in the Cloud

- **Pay as you go**: pay for what you use, remain agile, responsive, meet scale demands.
- **Save when you reserve**: minimize risks, predictably manage budgets, comply with long-term requirements.
  - Reservations are available for EC2 Reserverd Instance, DynamoDB Reserved Capacity, ElastiCache Reserverd Nodes, etc.
- **Pay less by using more**: volume-based discounts.
- **Pay less as AWS grows**: cost-reductions as aws data-centers are created, they are known to do cost-reduction yearly.


### Free services & Free tier in AWS

- IAM
- VPC
- Consolidated Billing
- Elastic Beanstalk         ---- you pay for the resources created
- CloudFormation            ---- you pay for the resources created

- [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

## Credits

Credits are applied in the following order:
1. Soonest expiring
2. Least number of applicable products
3.Oldest credit

## Pricing per services & networking

### EC2

- Charged for what you use
- Number of instances
- Instance configuration (phyical capacity, region, os and sotftware, instance type, instance size)
- ELB running time and amount of data processed

**Pricing Models**:
- On-demand instances:
  - Minimum of 60 second, you **pay per second** (Linux/Windows) or per hour
- Reserverd instances
  - Up to 75% discount compared to On-demand on hourly rate
  - 1-3 year commitmennt
  - All upfront, partial upfront, no upfront payment (less discount later you pay)
- Spot Instances
  - Up to 90% discount compared to On-demand on hourly rate
  - Bid for unused capacity (you can lose if someone wants to outbid you for the spot instances)
- Dedicated Host
  - On-demand
  - Reservation for 1-3 years commitment
- Saving Plans as an alternative to save on sustained usage

### Lambda

- pay per call

Note: Similar Service **Elastic File System (EFS)** (pay per use, has infrequent access & lifecycle rules)

### EBS

- Volume Type (based on performance)
- Storage volume in GB per month **provisioned**
- Input/Output operations per second (IOPS):
  - General Purpose SSD (included in the price)
  - Provisioned IOPS SSD - pay per provisioned amount in IOPS
  - Magnetic: Number of requests
- Snapshots (Added data cost per GB per month)
- Data Transfer (outbound data transfer are tiered for volume discounts, inbound is free)

### RDS

- Per hour billing
- Database characteristics:
  - Engine
  - Size
  - Memory Class
- Purchase Type
  - On-demand

- Additiona Storage (per GB per month)
- Number of I/O request per month
- Deplyoment Type (Single AZ/Multiple AZ)
- Data Transfer (outbound date transfer are tiered for volume discounts, inbound is free)

### Cloudfront

- Pricing different across geographic regions
- Aggregated for each edge location, then applied to your bill

- Trafic between regions costs ($0.02)

## Saving Plans

You have different type of plans where you commit a certain amount of dollars per hour for 1 or 3 years
- EC2 Saving Plans (commit to usage of individual instance families in a region)
- Compute Saving plans (for EC2, Fargate, Lambda), very flexible, it just requires a $ commitment, up to 66% reduction for a 1 or 3 years commitment
- Machine Learning Saving Plans for services like SageMaker

## Costs Tools
### Services for cost optimization

- [Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/): reduce costs and improve performance by recommending optimal aws for your workloads using ML. Also helps you choose optimal configurations and right-size your workloads (over/under provisioned). Supports: EC2, ASG, EBS, Lambda

### Estimating Costs
- [Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws): estimate the cost for your solution architecture

### Tracking Costs
- Billing Dashboard: shows an overview of the costs incured
  - also has a free tier dashboard to monitor free tier usage
- Cost Allocation Tags: allows to track costs on a detalied level. You also have [Tag Editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging-resources.html) to find and edit tags for your resources and group them in resources groups
- Cost and Usage Reports: a comprehensive & granular set of aws costs and data available, including additonal metadata about services, pricing and reservations. Can be integrated and analysed using Athena, Redshift and QuickSight.
- Cost Explorer: visualize, understand and manage your aws costs and usage over time. Create custom reports to analyze costs and usage at various degree of granularity (monthly, hourly, resource-level). Moreover, you can forecast usage up to 12 months based on previous usage and **helps you choose an optimal saving plans**

### Monitoring against costs
- Billing Alarms: you can create them with the use of the data from Cloud-Watch (region specific), it is used for actual costs not for projected costs.
- Budgets: create budget and send alarms when costs (or forecasts) exceed the budget
  - 3 types of budgest: Usage, Cost, Reservation
  - for Reserverd Instances (RI) it can track utilization
  - Supports up to 5 SNS (Simple Notification Service) notifications per budget
  - Can filter by service, linked account, tag, purchase option, instance type, region, etc.
  - Same options as Cost Explorer
  - 2 budgets are free, then they cost ($0.02/day/budget)
