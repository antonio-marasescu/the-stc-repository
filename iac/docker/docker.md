# Docker Standard Template Construct

## OS Kernel
The OS Kernel is responsible for interacting with the underlying hardware

## Container

### Definition
A Container is a lightweight, standalone and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.

### Segregation
It uses the operating system kernel, ensuring  consistency across environments.
They are isolated through a virtual network, being segregated from the host machine unless explicitly configured both in network and in the filesystem.

### Virtual Machines vs Containers

| **Aspect**         | **Containers**                                       | **Virtual Machines**                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**   | Share the host OS kernel; lightweight.              | Include a full OS with a hypervisor; heavier.       |
| **Startup Time**   | Fast (seconds).                                     | Slower (minutes).                                   |
| **Resource Usage** | Efficient; only includes app and dependencies.      | Resource-intensive; requires full OS and libraries.|
| **Isolation**      | Process-level isolation via namespaces and cgroups. | Full isolation through hypervisor and OS.          |
| **Portability**    | Highly portable across different OS environments.   | Less portable due to dependency on hypervisor.     |
| **Performance**    | Near-native performance; minimal overhead.          | Overhead from running a full OS and hypervisor.    |
| **Use Case**       | Microservices, lightweight apps, CI/CD pipelines.   | Monolithic apps, legacy systems, or OS-level testing.|

### Images

An Image is an lightweight, standalone and immutable blueprint for creating the container, containing the application code, dependencies and configuration for the executable package.
They have a layered structure, with each layer representing a change (e.g.: adding files or installing software).

### Volumes

A Volume is a mechanism of persisting data generated and used by the containers. They exist outside the container's file system and are managed by Docker.

### Network

A Network in Docker is feature that allows container to communicate with each other and external systems, providing isolated, configurable and secure connectivity for container in Docker. 

The following types exist:
- Bridge (Default): containers on the same bridge network can communicate via their container name
- Host: Shares the host's network namespace, removing network isolation
- None:  disables all networking, the container has no external communication
- Overlay: enables communication across multiple hosts in a Docker Swarm
- Macvlan: assigns a MAC address to containers (making them appear as physical devices on the network)
- Third-party Plugins (e.g.: Weave, Flannel)
