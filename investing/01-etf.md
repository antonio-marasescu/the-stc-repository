# Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)

## Definitions

### Mutual Fund

A mutual fund is a type of investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to collectively invest in a diversified portfolio of securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are managed by professional portfolio managers who allocate the fund's investments with the goal of achieving the investment objectives stated in the fund's prospectus.
Advantages of this include: 
- Diversification (Mutual funds invest in a variety of assets, which helps to spread risk)
- Professional Management(A professional portfolio manager or a team of managers make investment decisions on behalf of the fund's investors, aiming to meet the fund's objective)
- Liquidity (can be easily bought and sold)
- Affordability
- Variety

#### Important Notes

- Typical mutual funds are traded only once a day via the investment company.
- Are managed actively by an investor
### Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)

An ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks an index
You can look at an ETF from a certain perspective a combination of a mutual fund (attracts money from a large swat of investors) and an individual stock (they can be bought and sold during the whole stock exchange open hours, it has the name fund unit when considering an ETF).
#### Important Notes

1. The ETF are **managed passively**, thus instead of having a portfolio manager who tries through financial instruments to increase its value / outperform a target, it simply tracks a specific index or benchmark
2. If the value of the tracked index increase, then the portfolio value increases, inverse logic otherwise
3. An ETF has costs of administration lower than standard Mutual funds

#### Other Definitions
##### Investment Fund

 An investment fund is a collection point for the investors capital.

To put it simply, thousands of investors pool their funds and give the order to a professional (fund manager), to invest the funds as profitably as possible and with wide diversification in the context of a specified investment strategy.

##### Index Fund

The provider of an index fund ensures that it represents the development of an index as accurately as possible. The investments of an index fund (constituents and weightage) are exactly specified by the index. Indices are market barometers, which make the performance or return of total markets determinable.
##### Exchange Traded

ETFs are traded on the stock exchange similar to shares. Thus, you can buy and sell ETFs at any time during trading hours. In comparison to this, typical mutual funds are traded only once a day via the investment company.


## Working Mode

A **Fund Administrator** buys stocks for certain companies from an **Authorized Participant** (he gaining a number of ETF unit funds equal to transferred stock price).
From there, the **Authorized Participant** sells the ETF fund units to **Regular Investors** to regain his money.
Therefore, **Regular Investors** hold indirectly those stock options through the ETF unit funds.
## Types

### Per Content 

#### Equity (Stock) ETFs

Stock ETFs consist of shares of publicly traded companies. They aim to replicate the performance of a specific stock index or sector.
##### Example Types:
1. **Broad Market ETFs**:
	- **Example**: SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)
	- **Content**: Stocks from a broad market index like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000.

	- **Example**: Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)
	- **Content**: Stocks from a specific industry or sector, such as technology, healthcare, or finance.

	 - **Content**: Stocks centered around real estate investments, such as companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate. Fund that covers various sectors within the real estate market, including residential, commercial, industrial, and specialized properties.
#### Bond ETFs

Bond ETFs consist of bonds or other fixed-income securities. They aim to replicate the performance of a specific bond index or sector.

Bonds are popular because they’ve historically been less volatile than equities. Meanwhile, returns have been higher than cash although not as strong as equities over the long term.
Another positive feature is that highly rated government bonds have often performed well during times of market stress when equities falter.
This means bonds can be used to diversify a portfolio away from equities and to shore up returns during recessionary or deflationary conditions. As a low-risk portfolio component, bonds, therefore, help to reduce losses, especially in times of crisis.
##### Example Types:
1. **Government Bond ETFs**:
	- **Example**: iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)
	- **Content**: Bonds issued by governments, such as U.S. Treasury bonds or bonds from other sovereign governments.
2. **Corporate Bond ETFs**:
	- **Example**: iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD)

4. **International Bond ETFs**:
	- **Example**: iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB)
	- **Content**: Bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations.
5. **High-Yield Bond ETFs**:
	- **Example**: SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (JNK)
	- **Content**: Bonds with higher yields but higher risk, often referred to as junk bonds.
6. **Short-Term and Long-Term Bond ETFs**:
	 - **Example**: Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF (BSV)
	 - **Content**: Bonds with short-term maturities (1-3 years) or long-term maturities (10+ years), depending on the specific ETF.
#### Commodity ETFs

ETFs that invest in physical goods are typically known as Commodity ETFs. These ETFs can provide exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy resources, and agricultural products.

Commodities have shown a very low correlation to equities and bonds in the past, and strongly outperformed them both during the high inflation of the 1970s.
##### Example Types:
1. **Precious Metal ETFs:** (Gold, Silver, Platinum, etc)
2. **Energy ETFs:** (Crude Oil, Natural Gas, etc)
3. **Agricultural ETFs:** (Invest in physical agricultural commodities or futures contracts, such as grains, livestock, and other agricultural products)
4. **Industrial Metals ETFs:** (Invest in physical industrial metals such as copper, aluminum, and nickel.)
#### Leveraged ETFs

Leveraged ETFs are a type of exchange-traded fund that **aim to amplify the returns of an underlying index or asset**. They use financial derivatives and debt to achieve these enhanced returns, often on a daily basis. Leveraged ETFs are typically used by traders looking to capitalize on **short-term** movements in the market
#### Inversed ETFs

Inverse ETFs are a type of exchange-traded fund designed to provide the **opposite performance of a specific index or asset.** They achieve this inverse performance by using financial derivatives such as swaps and futures contracts. Inverse ETFs are typically used by traders to profit from a decline in the underlying index or as a hedging tool against potential losses in their portfolios.
### Per Dividends Rewards
#### Distributing

**Distributing ETFs** pay out the income generated from dividends or interest directly to shareholders, usually on a quarterly or semi-annual basis.
##### Key Characteristics:

- **Regular Income:** Investors receive regular payments, making these ETFs attractive for those seeking steady income, such as retirees.
- **Tax Considerations:** Distributed income may be subject to immediate taxation, depending on local tax laws.
- **Flexibility:** Investors can use the distributed income as they see fit, whether to reinvest in other assets or cover living expenses.
- **Preference for Income:** Ideal for investors who prefer receiving cash flow rather than having it automatically reinvested.
#### Accumulating

**Accumulating ETFs** automatically reinvest the income they generate from dividends or interest back into the fund. Instead of paying out this income to shareholders, the fund uses it to purchase additional assets.
##### Key Characteristics:

- **Reinvestment of Income:** Dividends and interest payments are reinvested in the fund, increasing the value of each share.
- **Tax Efficiency:** In some jurisdictions, reinvested income may have tax advantages, as it might not be subject to immediate taxation, unlike distributed income.
- **Compound Growth:** By reinvesting income, accumulating ETFs can benefit from compound growth, potentially leading to higher returns over the long term.
- **Simplicity for Investors:** Investors don’t need to manage or reinvest dividends themselves, which can be particularly advantageous for long-term, passive investors.
## How to analyze an ETF

1. See if it respects [UCITS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ucits.asp#:~:text=UCITS%20stands%20for%20Undertakings%20for,and%20cross%2Dborder%20investment%20opportunities.) regulations for EU, those that do this offer a better legal protection. It should contain "UCITS" in the ETF name
2. See your investment strategy
	- Is it managed actively or passively? (most of them are passive)
	- What kind of financial instrument does it use in its portfolio? (equity, bonds, commodities, etc)
	- On what kind of region/country is the ETF exposed to?
3. What kind of methods is it using to replicate the tracked index?
	-  Does it has [Physical Replication](https://www.justetf.com/en/academy/physical-replication-of-etfs.html): tracks an index by directly buying the underlying securities of the index. (most suggested)
		- Full Replication Method: replicates the index 1:1 by buying the stock.
		- Sampling Method: only the most important or liquid securities are purchased because these usually have the greatest influence on the index performance.
	- Does it has [Synthetic Replication](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synthetic-etf.asp): pooled investment that invests money in [derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) and [swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp) rather than in physical stock shares (less favored in recent times)
4. What is the ETF Currency?
	- There is a currency for the actual ETF on how it is managed by investment manager.
	- There is a currency for how the ETF is actual listed on the Stock Exchange.
	- There are different currencies for the stock that are used by the ETF (e.g.: Apple stock is in dollar, etc)
	- For many ETFs, they can be traded in different currencies (dollars, euros, etc)
	- You can look if the ETF is a [Currency-Hedged ETF](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/070815/how-currencyhedged-etfs-work.asp#:~:text=A%20currency%2Dhedged%20ETF%20is,if%20the%20currency%20price%20increases.) so it can reduce exposure to exchange rate risk
	- You should look for the ETF listed in the Stock Exchange for the currency you are most exposed of (personal opinion)
5. How are dividends working for that ETF?
	- Is is it Accumulating: the dividends are automatically reinvested (you don't **yet** have to pay taxes)
	- Is is Distributing: you receive the dividends directly and you decide what to do with it (you **have** to pay taxes for them this year)
6. Where is the location / country the ETF is registered
	 - This has implication in the taxes you are going to pay
	 - The most favorable ETF locations are:
		 - Ireland (especially if the ETF has stocks in USA companies)
		 - Luxemburg
7. What is the Total Expense Ration ([TER](https://help.revolut.com/en-RO/help/wealth/stocks/getting-started-with-etf-s/what-is-a-total-expense-ratio-for-etfs/))?
	- The total expense ratio is a measure of the total annual operating expenses of an ETF. It is expressed as a percentage of the ETFs assets and is deducted from the ETFs returns. Operating expenses may include administrative, legal fees and other costs associated with managing the ETF.
	- You need to look at the ETF with the smaller TER
	- For example, a TER of 0.20% means that, on average, you will pay the ETF manager 2 EURO per year for every 1,000 EUR invested in that ETF.
8. What is the value of the Assets Under Management ([AUM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20(AUM)%20is%20the%20total%20market%20value%20of,as%20a%20percentage%20of%20AUM.))
	- AUM is the sum of the market value for all of the investments managed by a fund or family of funds, a venture capital firm, a brokerage company, or an individual registered as an investment advisor or portfolio manager.
	- This influence the liquidity of the ETF:
		- If an ETF has a large portfolio then it has many investors that buy and sell the ETF fund units.
		- A more liquid ETF offers the advantage of smaller spreads. The spread is the difference between the selling price and the buying price, similar to what you see when you go to buy EURO at a currency exchange office.
	- Another factor influenced by the value of the asset portfolio is the likelihood of an ETF closing. It is said that an international ETF needs to manage assets worth over 100 million EUR/USD/GBP to operate efficiently. This is why it is recommended to focus on such ETFs.
9. Who is the administrator of the ETF
	- In Europe, there are dozens of fund managers. Each of them can offer an ETF that replicates the same stock index. Therefore, after you have analyzed all the other 8 aspects presented earlier, if you have narrowed down your options to two identical funds, you might choose the one offered by the manager who inspires more confidence.
### Where to find this information

1.  On the ETF's presentation page
2. In the Key Investor Information Document (KIID)
3. In the ETF's issuance prospectus;
## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Diversification**: ETFs offer exposure to a broad range of assets, sectors, or geographies, helping investors achieve diversification with a single investment.
2. **Lower Costs**: ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. They are also passively managed, which reduces management fees. For example to but a single stock from a S&P500 company cost over 7000$ compared to the cost of buying a fund unit in an ETF which tracks several S&P500 companies.
3. **Liquidity**: ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices, unlike mutual funds which trade at the end of the trading day.
4. **Transparency**: ETFs typically disclose their holdings on a daily basis, allowing investors to see exactly what they own.
5. **Tax Efficiency**: ETFs often have lower capital gains distributions compared to mutual funds, which can result in lower tax liabilities for investors.
6. **Flexibility**: Investors can use various trading strategies with ETFs, such as short selling, buying on margin, or placing limit and stop-loss orders.
7. **Access to Niche Markets**: ETFs provide access to specific sectors, commodities, or international markets that might be difficult to invest in directly.
### Disadvantages

1. **Trading Costs**: While expense ratios are low, frequent trading of ETFs can lead to high brokerage commissions, which can eat into returns.
2. **Spread Costs**: The difference between the bid and ask price (spread) can affect the total cost of investing in ETFs, especially for less liquid funds.
3. **Market Risk**: Like all investments, ETFs are subject to market risk. The value of an ETF can fluctuate based on the performance of the underlying assets.
4. **Tracking Error**: ETFs aim to replicate the performance of an index, but there can be small deviations due to management fees, transaction costs, or imperfect replication of the index.
5. **Complexity**: Some ETFs, particularly those that use leverage or are inverse ETFs, can be complex and may not be suitable for all investors.
6. **Dividend Yields**: ETFs might not have as high dividend yields as individual high-dividend stocks or mutual funds focused on income.
7. **Limited Control**: Investors in ETFs do not have control over the specific securities within the fund, which might be a disadvantage for those who prefer to choose their own investments.
## Taxes and Legal

### Romania
#### Income Tax

-  Starting in 2023, if the broker is considered Romanian, they will withhold the tax on the earnings at the source => the investor does not need to take any action
- The broker must send a document with the relevant values, which will be used for CASS payment
- A 3% tax on shares held and positions opened for less than 365 days, 1% for the opposite case
- Trading losses are not reported, not declared in the single declaration, and cannot be deducted from gains
#### Dividends

- The country of the company that paid the dividend matters
- Dividends obtained from Romanian companies through Romanian brokers:
	- The tax is withheld at the source by Romanian companies
	- We only receive the net amount
	- Only needs to be considered for CASS
- Dividends obtained from foreign companies through Romanian brokers:
	- These dividends must be registered as separate positions
	- The tax is not withheld at the source (foreign companies are not obliged to do so)
	- The tax must be declared and calculated for the Romanian state
	- The applicable tax rate on dividends is 8%
	- Pay attention to the Double Taxation Agreements (DTA) (tratatul de dublu-impunere):
		- If the company withholds a tax at the source
		- The investor must still declare it
		- That tax can be deducted if the double taxation treaty is imposed by the broker
			- It should appear on the broker's statement
			- If the treaty is not imposed, the investor does not have the right to deduct it in the calculation
		- If more than 8% is withheld at the source by a foreign company, only up to 8% is refunded in Romania
			- e.g., if you have 500 RON income, 8% tax in Romania: 40 RON, you paid at the source: 100 RON, in Romania you pay: 40 RON, you lose: 60 RON
#### Health Insurance Contribution (CASS)

According to Article 170 of the Fiscal Code, the health insurance contribution (CASS) is owed by the individual who earned or estimates to earn during the current year, income from investments (cumulatively with other types of income subject to contribution, such as from independent activities, intellectual property rights, associations with legal persons, leasing of goods, agricultural activities, forestry and fishing, and other sources) exceeding the threshold of 6 minimum gross wages for the respective year, both from Romania and abroad. The rate is 10% and is applied to a fixed base representing:
- The level of 6 minimum gross wages in the case of income between 6 and 12 minimum gross wages
- The level of 12 minimum gross wages in the case of income between 12 and 24 minimum gross wages
- The level of 24 minimum gross wages in the case of income exceeding 24 minimum gross wages

For the year 2023, the applicable minimum gross wage is 3,000 RON/month. Thus, the annual health insurance contribution will be:
- 1,800 RON for annual income between 18,000 RON and 35,999 RON
- 3,600 RON for annual income between 36,000 RON and 71,999 RON
- 7,200 RON for annual income of at least 72,000 RON
## Q&A

#### What happens when an ETF closes?

1. The fund management company announces the closure of the ETF. This includes a specific timeline and reasons for the closure.
2. The ETF stops creating new shares. This is to manage the existing shares and prevent dilution of assets during the closure process.
3. A date is set for the last day the ETF will trade on the stock exchange. Investors can buy or sell shares up to this date
4. After the last trading day, the fund manager begins selling the underlying assets of the ETF.
5. The cash proceeds are distributed to the shareholders in proportion to their holdings. This distribution is usually done within a few days to a few weeks after the final trading day.

**Potential Losses**: If the market value of the underlying assets has declined, investors might realize losses.
